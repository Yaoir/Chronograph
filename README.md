#### News: May 2019 Update

###### Running commands

Providing a command to run is now optional for the __timer__ and __alarm__ programs. This was done because I found __timer__ to be a useful replacement for __sleep(1)__. Instead of just pausing, __timer__ also displays the time remaining. For example:

```
for num in 1 2 3
do
	echo $num
	timer 5s
done
```

Under consideration is the idea of deprecating having commands run by __alarm__ or __timer__, and subsequently removing the feature entirely. Support for running a command when the alarm or timer triggered seemed like a good idea initially because that is the way single purpose alarm clocks and kitchen timers operate. In practice, it works better to use the shell's ability to tie commands together to add functionality, as in these examples:

$ alarm 2:34pm; echo "Time to get ready for the interview!"

$ timer 20m && echo "Time to take a short break!"

The first example runs the __echo__ program no matter how __alarm__ exited, and the second runs the command only if the timer counted all the way down to zero.

###### Exit codes

__alarm__ and __timer__ exit codes now mean the following:
```
0 Normal command exit (timer reached 0)
1 Quit by user (with `q` key)
2 Quit by Control-C or SIGKILL
3 Error (bad arguments)
```
This is to make __alarm__ and __timer__ more useful in scripts. While the clock is running, you can type either a `q` or `Control-C` to quit, resulting in a different exit code. In the script, inspect the error code and handle the condition appropriately.

For example, a `q` might result in the timer ending early while allowing the script to continue running, but a `Control-C` would cause the script to exit with an error condition:

```
timer 30s
# ignore user quit, but exit if interrupted
if [ $? -eq 2 ]
then
	exit 1
fi
```

##### A few late additions to the documentation:

###### Using the programs as GUI apps

The distribution includes shell scripts __alarm-gui__, __clock-gui__, __stopwatch-gui__, and __timer-gui__ as examples of how to run the programs within a virtual terminal so they act more like GUI apps. They all depend on __konsole(1)__ for the virtual terminal. You will need to modify them if you want to use another virtual terminal.

###### Makefile functions - installation

The included __Makefile__ contains rules for installing the programs, __*program*-gui__ shell scripts, and manual pages. Set the variables __BINDIR__, __SSDIR__, and __MANDIR__ in __Makefile__ appropriately before running one of

```
make install
```
and/or
```
make install-ss
```
and/or
```
make install-man
```

to install the programs, shell scripts, and/or manual pages, respectively.

### Introduction

Chronograph is a group of command line programs that implement functions found in a chronograph watch.

The programs are:

```
alarm - alarm clock
clock - wall clock
stopwatch - stopwatch
timer - countdown timer
```

### Quick Start

In the example commands, `$` is used to indicate a shell prompt.

Compile:

```
$ go build alarm.go
$ go build clock.go
$ go build stopwatch.go
$ go build timer.go
```
or if you have GNU make installed:
```
$ make
```

Run:

```
$ clock
$ stopwatch
$ timer 10s echo done
$ alarm <clock_time> echo done
```

ALARM(1)                         User Commands                        ALARM(1)

NAME
       alarm - alarm clock

SYNOPSIS
       alarm time [ command ]

DESCRIPTION
       alarm(1)  is  a  command  line alarm clock. It displays the time of day
       until reaching the specified time.

       Before exiting, it optionally runs a command.

ARGUMENTS
       The first argument specifies the time the alarm clock is set to go off.

       The rest of the arguments, if present, are treated as a command to  run
       when the alarm triggers.

EXAMPLES
       An  alarm  set to play an mp3 (with the command aplay alarmbell.mp3) at
       2:30 pm (14:30):

       alarm 2:30pm aplay alarmbell.mp3

       An alarm set to print "hello, world" at 9 pm (21:00):

       alarm 21:00 echo "hello, world"

       Reminder to feed the cat at 10am:

       alarm 10am echo feed the cat

BUGS
       The time is always shown with a 24-hour clock, even when the  alarm  is
       set with a 12-hour clock.
