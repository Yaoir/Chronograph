timer(1) -- countdown timer
===========================

## SYNOPSIS

`timer` _duration_

## DESCRIPTION

timer(1) is a countdown timer.

While the timer is running, the remaining time is displayed. The command exits when the time remaining reaches 0.

## ARGUMENTS

The argument specifies the duration. Some examples of valid arguments follows:

```
5s        Five seconds
22.9s     Twenty-two and 9/10 seconds
179s      179 seconds (or two minutes and 59 seconds)
7m        Seven minutes
32m30s    32Â½ minutes
1h45m     One hour and 45 minutes
2h56m4s   Two hours, 56 minutes, and 4 seconds
5h        Five hours
100h      One hundred hours
```

## EXAMPLES

Pause for 5 seconds, showing the countdown:

`timer 5s`

After 2 minutes and 30 seconds, play an mp3 (with the command `aplay alarmbell.mp3`):

`timer 2m30s && aplay alarmbell.mp3`

Print "hello, world" after waiting 21 minutes:

`timer 21m && echo "hello, world"`

## EXIT VALUES

```
0 Normal command exit (timer reached 0)
1 Quit by user (with q key)
2 Quit by Control-C or SIGKILL
3 Error (bad arguments)
```

When using **timer** in loop in a shell script, use this code to have the script exit when the timer is interrupted, either with a **q** or **Q** keypress, or a Control-C or SIGKILL from another source:

```
timer 600s
# exit if interrupted
if [ $? -ne 0 ]
then
    exit 1
fi
```

The following causes the shell script to exit if it receives an interrupt signal (Control-C), but if the user types a **q** or **Q**, **timer** will quit early, and the loop inside the shell script will continue to execute:

```
timer 600s
# ignore user quit with q or Q key,
# but exit if interrupted with SIGKILL (Control-C)
if [ $? -eq 2 ]
then
    exit 1
fi
```

## BUGS

The time is always shown with a 24-hour clock, even when the duration is set with a 12-hour clock.
